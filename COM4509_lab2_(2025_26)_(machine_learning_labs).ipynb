        "`OneHotEncoder()` and `StandardScaler()` are examples of [data transformations](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html). In scikit-learn these are referred to as *transformers* and they map the data from one format to another. In a programming context, transformers are classes. They come with the following methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `fit` that is used to learn the  transformation from data.\n",
        "- `transform` that is used to transform the data once the transformer has been fitted.   \n",
        "- `fit_transform` that applies first `fit` and then `transform` to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, we use either `fit` or `fit_transform` for the training data and `transform` for the validation or test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the one-hot-encoding and standardisation transformations are often used, rather than code such function from scratch we make use of the [ColumnTransformer()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html?highlight=columntransformer#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer), an estimator available in scikit-learn that allows to group different transformations into a single method. `ColumnTransformer` is an example of an *estimator* in scikit-learn. An estimator is an object that provides predictions for new data."
